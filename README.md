# vnew
Quickly create new files or folders (folders end with `/`).

## Examples:
```
vnew abd/def/x.txt
```
... creates the abd/def/ folder if it does not exist already, and then add a new empty file x.txt inside it.


```
vnew a.txt b.txt abcd/xyz.txt folder/
```
... creates all 3 files, then create an empty `folder/` too.
